# Simple webpage for displaying skills as proof.


The goal of this page is to demonstrate basic React fluency via an app
that allows the user to add skills that they may possess to a list displayed on
the page. The list can be accessed  by clicking on ```Skills```. New skills can be added
by clicking the ```Add Skills``` button.


To install dependencies, run 
```npm install```

After all dependencies have been installed , the program can be run via
```npx gulp``` . 


If it does not automatically open a browser window, you can go to 
*http://localhost:5500*.


## Notes

As of 1/8/2020, additions made to skills will not be saved if the server is stopped. The data is not yet persistent.
