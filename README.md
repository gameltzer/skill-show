# A simple webapp for viewing and adding a list of skills.


The goal of this app is to demonstrate basic React fluency via an app
that allows the user to add skills that they may possess to a list displayed on
the page. The list can be accessed  by clicking on ```Skills```. New skills can be added
by clicking the ```Add Skills``` button.

Make sure before doing the below steps that you are in the skill-show folder.

To install dependencies, run 
```npm install```

After all dependencies have been installed , the program can be run via
```npx gulp``` 




If it does not automatically open a browser window, you can go to 
*http://localhost:5500*.


## Notes

As of 1/8/2020, additions made to skills will not be saved if the server is stopped. The data is not yet persistent.
